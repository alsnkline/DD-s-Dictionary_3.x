    <h1  align="center"> DD's Dictionary</h1>
    <h3 id="Close" align="center"> The Dyslexic's Dictionary</h3>
    <p>I have had to work hard to manage my reading and writing challenges all my life and am now supporting my daughter as she starts  the same journey. I decided to create DD's dictionary (The Dyslexic’s Dictionary) to give those having difficulty spelling, a tool for independent discovery of an unknown spelling or a quick check of an uncertain one.</p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who have clicked on the 'Talk to us' option and provided fantastic ideas and encouragement. I have been able to include a number of  suggestions and plan to add more.</p>

    <h2>Future enhancements </h2>        
    <p>Please keep your thougths and ideas for future enhancements flowing in. Here is an updated list of ideas:</p>
    <ul>            
        <li>The ability to immediately add your own words</li>
        <li>Additional word grouping, eg hard to spell words ideal for adult Dyslexic’s</li>
        <li>Sounds like search</li>
        <li>Easy exploration of words that have UK/US differences</li>
        <li>Present related words together eg following, follows, followed, follow.</li>
        <li>Show easily confused word groups eg for, of, from, form</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Thank you - Alison
